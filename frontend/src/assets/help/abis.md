  - isEmpty: true if the ABI could not be found (and won't be looked for again)
  - hasConstructor: if verbose and the abi has a constructor, then `true`, else `false`
  - hasFallback: if verbose and the abi has a fallback, then `true`, else `false`
  - functions: the functions for this address

- **Functions Store (10 members)**
