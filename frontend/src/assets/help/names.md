# Names Management

Welcome to the **Names** view! This section allows you to manage address names and their associated metadata.

## Overview

The Names view provides a comprehensive interface for managing address names, which are human-readable labels associated with Ethereum addresses. This helps you identify and organize addresses across different categories.

## Tabs Overview

1. **All**: Displays all names across all categories
2. **Custom**: User-created custom names for addresses
3. **Prefund**: Genesis and pre-funding addresses
4. **Regular**: Standard addresses with names
5. **Baddress**: Flagged or problematic addresses

## Features

### View and Search

- Browse names by category using the tabs
- Search and filter names by address, name, or other fields
- Sort by any column (address, name, tags, source, etc.)

### CRUD Operations

- **Create**: Add new custom names for addresses
- **Update**: Edit existing name information
- **Delete/Undelete**: Soft delete/restore names
- **Remove**: Permanently remove names
- **Autoname**: Automatically generate names for addresses

### Data Fields

- **Address**: The Ethereum address (40-character hex string)
- **Name**: Human-readable name for the address
- **Tags**: Categorization tags
- **Source**: Where the name originated (Chifra, custom, etc.)
- **Symbol**: Token symbol (if applicable)
- **Decimals**: Token decimal places (if applicable)

## Tips

- Use tags to organize and categorize your custom names
- The source field indicates where the name data originated
